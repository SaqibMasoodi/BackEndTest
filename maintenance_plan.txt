Asset Maintenance Strategy

Problem
The current strategy requires three steps to add an image:
1. Save image to disk.
2. `import` it in the JS file.
3. Assign the variable.

This is tedious for content updates, especially if you want to add/remove instructors or packages frequently.

Recommended Solution: The `public/` Directory
Move dynamic content images (hotels, packages, instructors) to a `public/` folder.

How it works
Vite serves everything in `public/` at the root URL path. Files are not bundled (hashed), but copied as-is to the build folder.

New Workflow
1. Save image: `public/images/new-hotel.jpg`
2. Update Data: Just write the string path!
   {
       image: "/images/new-hotel.jpg"
   }
   No imports needed.

Implementation Steps
1. Move Images: Move the following folders from `assets/images/` to `public/images/`:
   - `home/guides`
   - `home/attractions`
   - `stays`
   - `packages`
2. Update Data Files: Bulk find-and-replace in `instructors.js`, `attractions.js`, `hotels.js`, and `packages.js`:
   - Remove all top-level `import ...` lines.
   - Replace variables (e.g., `shafqatImg`) with simple string paths (e.g., `"/images/home/guides/shafqat.webp"`).

Trade-offs
Feature                     | Current (Imports)          | Public Folder (Proposed)
----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------
Ease of Adding Images       | Low (Requires coding)      | High (Drag & Drop)
Browser Caching             | Excellent (Auto-hashing)   | Good (Filename based)
Broken Link Detection       | High (Build fails)         | Low (Runtime error)

Recommendation
For a content-heavy site where you might frequently update images without deploying code changes, the Public Folder strategy is much easier to maintain.
